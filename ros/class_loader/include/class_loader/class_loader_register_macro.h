/**
* @macro This is the macro which must be declared within the source (.cpp) file for each class that is to be exported as plugin.
* The macro utilizes a trick where a new struct is generated along with a declaration of static global variable of same type after it. The struct's constructor invokes a registration function with the plugin system. When the plugin system loads a library with registered classes in it, the initialization of static variables forces the invocation of the struct constructors, and all exported classes are automatically registerd.
