# This example assumes that testserver in dynamic_reconfigure is running
# with its default node name, and will show how to reconfigure it from
# python.
#
# Note that testserver often changes the parameters it is given, so the
# values you get back from it will often be different from the ones you
# requested. Look at test/testserver.cpp to understand the changes that are
# being made to the parameters.
#
# In one window do:
# rosrun dynamic_reconfigure testserver
#
# In another window do:
# rosrun dynamic_reconfigure testclient.py
