    -----
    If both positive and negative infinity are present, the sum will be Not

    Numpy integer arithmetic is modular. If the size of a sum exceeds the

        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the variance is computed.  The default is to compute
        the variance of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
        the default is `float32`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
        the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type is cast if
        necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements. By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the variance,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array. If ddof is >= the
        number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice contains only
        NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
    population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
    variance for normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis, while

    Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a
    distribution, of the non-NaN array elements. The standard deviation is
    computed for the flattened array by default, otherwise over the
    specified axis.

    For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is
    returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Calculate the standard deviation of the non-NaN values.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the standard deviation is computed. The default is
        to compute the standard deviation of the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type to use in computing the standard deviation. For arrays of
        integer type the default is float64, for arrays of float types it
        is the same as the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the
        calculated values) will be cast if necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
        is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements.  By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    standard_deviation : ndarray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard
        deviation, otherwise return a reference to the output array. If
        ddof is >= the number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice
        contains only NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean: ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is
    specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard
    statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the
    variance of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum
    likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.
    The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype`
    keyword can alleviate this issue.
