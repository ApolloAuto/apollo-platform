    A single maintainer will set the keys "maintainer" and
    "maintainer_email" while multiple maintainers are merged into the
    "maintainer" fields (including their emails). Authors are handled
    likewise.

    The first URL of type "website" (or without a type) is used for
    the "url" field.

    The "description" is taken from the eponymous tag if it does not
    exceed 200 characters. If it does "description" contains the
    truncated text while "description_long" contains the complete.
